Simple Yelp search client (iOS)

Complete all required tasks:
- Search results page

Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).


- Filter page.
The filters include: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
Use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
Radius filter expands as in the real Yelp app
Categories shows a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
